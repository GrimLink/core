# Contributing

To work with this project, you need to clone and checkout the `<develop>` branch and then install all dependencies. We prefer [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as package manager, so consider it instead of NPM.

## Development
Run the local development server with autorefresh by running:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Build
You can build all the packages by running this command.

```bash
yarn build
```
